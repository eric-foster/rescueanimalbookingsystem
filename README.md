## Welcome To The Rescue Animal Booking System
A booking system ran through terminal in order to do the following:
1. Create new Dog and Monkey profiles and add them to an existing system.
2. Reserve an animal for service
3. Print a list of all dogs, monkeys, available animals not yet reserved, and unavailable animals already reserved and in service

This project is designed for a fictional Pet Rescue Company
